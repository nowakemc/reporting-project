# Aparavi Reporting Dashboard Development Log

## Session: February 27, 2025

### Dark Mode Compatibility

**Issue:** The dashboard needed to ensure text visibility across different system themes.

**Solution:**
- Added custom CSS with explicit color settings for text elements
- Created a custom Streamlit theme configuration 
- Added special styling for tables, metrics, and interactive elements
- Applied Aparavi branding colors in a dark-mode compatible way

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `.streamlit/config.toml` for theme settings
- Updated the `apply_custom_css()` function in `app.py`
- Added custom styling for welcome message and UI components
- Used `!important` flags to ensure styles take precedence

**Additional Improvements:**
- Created `run.sh` script to ensure clean starts between sessions
- Updated README.md with new usage instructions

### Large Scale Database Support

**Issue:** The dashboard needed to scale from small datasets (5K objects) to massive ones (1M, 10M, 25M+ objects).

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive scaling strategy
- Implemented smart database indexing
- Added data sampling for visualizations
- Created pagination for data tables
- Added database optimization capabilities

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `modules/large_scale.py` with scaling utilities
- Added database scale detection and recommendations
- Implemented three optimization buttons:
  1. Create Indexes: Adds indexes to the current database
  2. Optimize DuckDB: Configures runtime settings for large datasets
  3. Optimize Database File: Creates a new optimized copy with compression

**Database File Optimization:**
- Creates a compressed copy of the database with intelligent indexing
- Reports performance metrics (time, size reduction)
- Preserves the original file with a backup
- Shows clear paths to the new optimized database

**Documentation:**
- Created detailed scaling strategy in `docs/scaling_strategy.md`
- Added inline comments explaining optimization techniques
- Created UI elements to show database scale information

## Current State

The Aparavi Reporting Dashboard now features:
- Complete dark mode compatibility
- Ability to scale to 25M+ objects with good performance
- Clean startup process to avoid database locking
- Database optimization capabilities with detailed metrics
- Document lifecycle analysis and security governance reports

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:
- Add machine learning for predictive analytics
- Implement more advanced visualization techniques
- Develop comprehensive test suite
- Add more granular document lifecycle metrics
